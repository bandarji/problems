# Palindrome Linked List

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or
false otherwise.

## Examples

```
Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

* The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9

## Follow Up

Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?
